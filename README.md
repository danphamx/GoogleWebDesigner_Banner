I made an interactive expandable ad banner for my cat using Google Web Designer!

**About**

You'll notice that there are no JS files in my repo here, and that's because Google Web Designer (GWD) packages everything for you (minifies, does polite loading, and flatten files) whether you're using AdMob or Doubleclick. Once you're done using the WYSIWIG, you just hit 'Publish' and GWD takes care of the rest magically. Learn more about Google Web Designer here:

**To get a demo,** you'll need to unpackage the Zip file: src/published_ad_with_edits.zip.

updates:
6/25/14: found a bug with GWD where some of my banner's css, overflow:hidden, was not exported to the .zip file (they also strip my autoplay parameter), not sure if that's intended behavior for admob or doubleclick files, but to get it looking nice I modified the exported .zip manually.
