I made an interactive extensible ad banner for my cat using Google Web Designer!

**About**
You'll notice that there are no JS files in my repo here, and that's because Google Web Designer (GWD) packages everything for you (minifies, does polite loading, and flatten files) whether you're using AdMob or Doubleclick. Once you're done using the WYSIWIG, you just hit 'Publish' and GWD takes care of the rest magically. Learn more about Google Web Designer here:

**To get a demo,** you'll need to unpackage the Zip file: published_ad.zip.
